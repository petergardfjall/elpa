# elpa
Emacs packages installed via `package.el`.

Intended to track the revision history of packages in my Emacs installation over
time, allowing easy rollbacks to a working state when package updates bring the
installation into a bad state. Included as a git submodule in my
[.emacs.d](https://github.com/petergardfjall/.emacs.d).
